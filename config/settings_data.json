When your body chemistry is complete, you sleep better at night and this is when your body experiences the most recovery from fatigue. Live vitamins are also essential for the body to convert proteins into new healthy cells like muscles, tendons, joints and the cardiovascular system etc. (If you sleep better, you will recover more from fatigue and therefore you won’t get as tired during the next day.) B vitamins and especially B-3 (Niacin) and Arginine, allow the blood flow to circulate easier through the cardiovascular system for enhanced oxygen delivery for more stamina and mental focus. Direct delivery to the blood stream allows the unaltered live nutrients to positively affect the body’s performance for that competitive edge when dissolved under the tongue just minutes prior to strenuous activity."}},"4c1b3e35-1a75-49c8-910e-12c44d79a9a5":{"type":"text","settings":{"question":"ARE THERE STIMULANTS IN SPORT FORMULA?","answer":"NO, there is not.

Please breathe through your nose while the powder is in your mouth so you don't accidentally inhale the powder in your mouth and choke and spit it out onto your shirt. So you have been warned, please be careful and breathe through your nose. When the powder is melting it also absorbed through the membrane in your mouth going directly to your bloodstream allowing the vitamin B12 methylcobalamin to absorb fully. This allows Direct Delivery to the bloodstream making you feel the effects of the raw nutrients within minutes. Or, you can add Sport Formula to water or any drink or even your food. Sport Formula absorbs 100% either way to the bloodstream, nothing is wasted like a compressed tablet would be."}},"f1852e22-5eb5-4062-932d-dd7084cd30fd":{"type":"text","settings":{"question":"WHAT IS SPORT FORMULA?","answer":"Sport Formula is cold processed, live nutrients like raw vegetables.

However, you can take Sport Formula up to three times per day if you want to enhance benefits from fatigued Or anytime you want a boost of energy and mental focus.<br><strong>Examples of why you might take Sport Formula up more often:<\/strong><br><strong>Example 1:<\/strong> If you are recovering from surgery you would want to take small amounts all day long of these vital nutrients so you could heal quicker just like if you were hooked up to an IV in the hospital. By making the nutrients available to the bloodstream, your body would have building blocks ready to use to heal quicker.<br><strong>Example 2:<\/strong> If you are a professional athlete and you reach high levels of fatigue from training hard you would want to take it several times a day to enhance your recovery process.<br><strong>Example 3:<\/strong> If you are an athlete and you are going to compete, you would take Sport Formula right before competition. Once you are accustomed to the formula, you could take two or three servings at one time if your body allows you to. There is a possibility that you could feel warm and tingly from the niacin B3 which enhances blood circulation to the surface of the skin. experimenting with this during practice would be best so as not to interrupt a competition with itchy skin.<br><strong>Example 4:<\/strong> If you feel like you are getting sick and a cold is coming on, you could take three servings at one time to knock it out before it starts. as stated above, you may feel warm and tingly and have itchy red skin from the niacin B3 which enhances blood circulation to the skin. so do not be alarmed, the feeling passes in about 20 minutes. In my opinion, it's better to feel itchy a little bit and not get sick.<br><strong>Example 5:<\/strong> You work hard all day long and you don't want to keep taking Red Bull or energy drinks, you should take Sport Formula and add it to water and drink it several times throughout the course of the day to maintain a healthy energy level without stimulants.<br><strong>Note:<\/strong> Sport Formula is good for you every time you take it. You actually do something good for your body. Amino acids are building blocks, the vitamins control your metabolism andI enhance blood circulation and remove toxins. There are no stimulants so it is helpful each time you take it.<\/p>"}},"2b578919-515b-448a-abca-bbe39590bb88":{"type":"text","settings":{"question":"IS IT NORMAL TO FEEL WARM, TINGLY, ITCHY OR EVEN TURN RED AFTER TAKING SPORT FORMULA THE FIRST TIME?","answer":"If this happened, DO NOT BE ALARMED. The feeling will pass in 20 minutes or so. This just means its working… Sorry if this caught you by surprise, Sport Formula is highly potent and strong because it dissolves 100%. You may need to get used to it for a while, unlike a pill that does nothing because it never dissolves. About 1 person in 100 will have a strong reaction to Vitamin B-3 Niacin and be caught by surprise, even though it is mentioned on the packet. This is a normal reaction to this beneficial nutrient that will affect some people that try it for the first couple of times. You may feel a strong sensation on the skin, for about 20 minutes; due to Vitamin B-3 (Niacin) which increases blood circulation to the surface of your skin, if you are not accustomed to it. We apologize if this has happened to you and you have felt the least bit uncomfortable. Please take half servings for the next few days until your body can adjust properly and then start taking more until you are taking full servings again."}},"649ac33f-8ba0-4c2c-8463-fda6e53b33d0":{"type":"text","settings":{"question":"WHAT IS THE BEST TIME TO TAKE SPORT FORMULA?","answer":"The best time to take Sport Formula is daily at a minimum.

The smaller the child, the less that they take. For instance, a small child under 6 would take a quarter of an adult serving. a child over 6 to 12 would take up to half of one adult serving. A child over 12 can take a whole serving if they don't get itchy and red from the niacin B3. Sport Formula contains vital nutrients that are desperately needed buy children while they're developing their bones and ligaments and tissues. Food does not contain everything your child needs. You must supplement somehow. We recommend that you use Sport Formula 100% so that your child can develop to his or her full potential. a lack of nutrients during the development cycle of a child will result in a smaller undeveloped child.

For instance, if you take Sport Formula with protein powder, you will process approximately 30% more protein into muscle instead of wasting it.

So starving doesn’t work, you’ll need raw vitamins.<\/p><p>3) You must keep eating but the food has got to be low in calories, high in fiber and hard to digest. This and raw vitamins together keep your metabolism going so you can use up your fat reserves.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>Instead of eating a high calorie meal, eat high fiber vegetables to keep your appetite under control and keep your metabolism going.<\/strong><\/p><p><\/p><p>Your stomach will be full whether you eat a double cheese burger fries and soda (2500 calories) or if you eat entire bunch of celery stalks (negative 10 to 100 calories). The cheese burger fries and soda will overload you with calories that you can’t use fast enough so you store fat. The celery will actually use more calories for digestion than it provides and burn calories like doing cardio without actually doing any.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>Let’s Put Your Calorie Intake Into Perspective:<\/strong><\/p><p><\/p><p>1) It takes 1 hour of strenuous cardio to burn just 500 calories off.<\/p><p>2) A cheese burger, fries and a soda take 5 hours of cardio to burn off.<\/p><p>The idea here is that your body can only use a certain amount of calories at one time and then you will store the rest as fat. That is why the above cheese burger fries and soda makes you fat. It’s not more calories than you can use in one day, it’s just more than you can use in one meal or several hours. Your body is able to digest and convert the calories to be used as energy faster than your body can actually use them as energy, so the extra is stored as fat.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Another big problem with the cheese burger fries and soda is that all the ingredients have been heat processed to kill bacteria and extend the shelf life, which kills the raw vitamins. Raw, unheated vitamins convert carbs and stored body fats into energy. So if your food has no fresh raw vitamins, you’ll be storing fat instead of making energy.<br\/><\/p><p><strong>So Take Sport Formula RAW Powder Vitamins To Get Faster Results.<\/strong><\/p>","link":"shopify:\/\/collections\/formula","content_btn_text":"Check Out Sport Formula!","title_two":"They Are Finally Revealed!
