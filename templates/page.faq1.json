However, live vitamins, such as those found in our Multivitamins, are essential for the body to metabolize carbohydrates and fats into energy. Therefore, increased intake of live vitamins enhances the conversion of carbohydrates and stored fat into energy. <br><br>\nSecondly, as these live vitamins help complete your body chemistry, your body becomes more efficient and functions the way it is supposed to. Therefore, you sleep better at night, which is the time your body experiences the most recovery from the fatigue and stress of daily life. When you sleep better, you recover more from fatigue and so you won’t get as tired during the next day. During this time, as well as throughout the day, these live vitamins assist the body in converting proteins into new healthy cells such as muscles, tendons, joints, the cardiovascular system, etc. <br><br>\nThirdly, B vitamins – especially B-3 (Niacin) – and Arginine, stimulate and enhance blood circulation throughout the cardiovascular system. This improves oxygen delivery for more stamina and mental focus while boosting the removal waste and toxins. <br><br>\nAnd so, with a cleaner, detoxed body getting more quality nutrients delivered to its organs more efficiently, you can experience a smooth increase of energy and a steady state of alertness."}},"62d31f8f-bc5e-4214-87ea-0dfad92a9a8d":{"type":"text","settings":{"question":"ARE THERE STIMULANTS IN SPORT FORMULA?","answer":"NO.

To do this, simply pour the powder under your tongue and let it dissolve. When doing this, please breathe through your nose while the powder is in your mouth, so you don't accidentally inhale the powder in your mouth and choke and spit it out onto your shirt. <br><br>\nSo, you have been warned, please be careful and breathe through your nose. When the powder is melting, it also absorbed through the membrane in your mouth going directly to your bloodstream allowing the vitamin B12 methylcobalamin to absorb fully. This allows direct delivery to the bloodstream making you feel the effects of the raw nutrients within minutes. <br><br>\nYou can also add Sport Formula to water or any drink or even your food.

This allows you to recover fully from fatigue and gets your body running more efficiently. However, you can take Sport Formula up to three times per day if you want to enhance benefits from fatigued or anytime you want a boost of energy and mental focus.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Examples of when you might take Sport Formula more often:<\/strong>\n<br>\n<strong>Example 1:<\/strong> If you are recovering from surgery you would want to take small amounts all day long of these vital nutrients so you could heal quicker just like if you were hooked up to an IV in the hospital. By making the nutrients available to the bloodstream, your body would have the building blocks ready to use to heal quicker.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Example 2:<\/strong> If you are a professional athlete and you reach high levels of fatigue from training hard, then you would want to take it several times a day to enhance your recovery process.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Example 3:<\/strong> If you are an athlete and you are going to compete, take the Sport Formula Multivitamin right before competition. Once you are accustomed to the formula, you could take two or three servings at one time if your body allows you to. There is a possibility that you could feel warm and tingly from the niacin B3 which enhances blood circulation to the surface of the skin. This is known as a Niacin flush. Experimenting with this during practice would be best so as not to potentially interrupt a competition with itchy, tingly skin.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Example 4:<\/strong> If you feel like you are getting sick and a cold is coming on, you could take three servings at one time to knock it out before it starts. As stated above, you may a niacin flush. So do not be alarmed, the feeling passes in about 20 minutes. In my opinion, it's better to feel itchy a little bit and not get sick.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Example 5:<\/strong> You work hard all day long and you don't want to keep taking energy drinks, you should take Sport Formula and add it to water and drink it several times throughout the course of the day to maintain a healthy energy level without stimulants.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Note:<\/strong> Sport Formula is good for you every time you take it. You actually do something good for your body. Amino acids are building blocks and the vitamins control your metabolism, enhance blood circulation, and remove toxins. There are no stimulants, so it is helpful each time you take it.\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}},"620ed3f9-9ce9-41fb-876f-d4706c7b8f06":{"type":"text","settings":{"question":"IS IT NORMAL TO FEEL WARM, TINGLY, ITCHY, OR EVEN TURN RED AFTER TAKING SPORT FORMULA MULTIVITAMINS THE FIRST TIME?","answer":"About 1 person in 100 will have a strong reaction to Vitamin B-3 Niacin and is a normal reaction to this beneficial nutrient that affects some people trying it the first couple of times. If this happens, DO NOT BE ALARMED. \n<br><br>\nThis is known as a Niacin Flush. The feeling will pass in 20 minutes or so and simply means it is working… You may feel a strong sensation on the skin lasting 15 to 20 minutes. This is due to the Niacin increasing blood circulation to the surface of your skin when you are not yet accustomed to it. \n<br><br>\nSorry if this caught you by surprise and if you have felt the least bit uncomfortable, even though it is mentioned on the packaging.  Our Sport Formula Multivitamin is highly potent and strong because it dissolves 100%. Therefore, you may need to get used to it for a while, unlike a pill that does nothing because it never dissolves. \n<br><br>\nTo mitigate the Niacin flush, split your serving up for the next few days i.e., half when you wake up and half at lunchtime. This will allow your body to acclimate itself to the Niacin.

Most modern-day food, however, does not contain everything your child needs and a lack of nutrients during a child’s development will result in that child lacking in certain areas.
