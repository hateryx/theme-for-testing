Great! You've made a positive choice in the right direction. Now, more than ever, it is time to continue that momentum and give yourself every advantage. The most important advantage you need is premium nutrient absorption - particularly vitamin absorption as vitamin deficiency is a major concern for bariatric patients. \n<br><br>This procedure helping you lose weight can also have devastating effects due to your now limited ability to absorb life giving nutrients. Therefore, it is absolutely critical for you to optimize your absorption at all levels.\n\n<br><br>This is why Sport Formula Multivitamin Powder is your bariatric solution. Our raw powder multi-nutrients are ALIVE!
