Soy protein has been proven to have an adverse effect on your thyroid. And while whey protein is good in and of itself, the problem with most whey protein supplements is that their whey content is hardly pure and is often mixed with other additives, fillers, and various other things which is why many folks often complain about bloating and indigestion as the digestive tract is having issues breaking down the supplement. \n<p><\/p>\n<p>\nChickpea protein, as it is plant-based, has numerous benefits to a wider range of individuals and is not subject to the same issues in processing as other proteins. \n\nIt also contains essential key nutrients to support digestion and bone health while boosting immune health and reducing inflammation. Research published in the Canadian Medical Journal, revealed that one serving daily of legumes like chickpea can significantly reduce your bad cholesterol and the risk of cardiovascular disease. <\/p>\n<\/div>","embed":"<div class=\"wistia_responsive_padding\" style=\"padding:100.0% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><div class=\"wistia_responsive_wrapper\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/fast.wistia.net\/embed\/iframe\/l31x7c239h?videoFoam=true\" title=\"Chickpea Testimonial Video\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"wistia_embed\" name=\"wistia_embed\" allowfullscreen=\"\" msallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" id=\"frme_l31x7c239h\"><\/iframe><\/div><\/div>"}},"c806f51f-0032-4adb-a09a-d8ae6fe40171":{"type":"select","settings":{"flip":false,"text":"<h1 class=\"title-xl\">100% NON-GMO CERTIFIED ORGANIC AND VEGAN…<\/h1>\n<div class=\"title-ls\">Our premium quality chickpea powder is all natural and a perfect complement for people that are following a plant based diet. <p><\/p>\n<p>Whether you are supplementing your diet for the multitude of health benefits including cardiovascular, bone health and increased muscle density, or you are using it to jumpstart your metabolism with a keto diet to lose weight, Sport Formula Chickpea protein powder makes a delicious meal replacement and provides the added fuel needed to keep you at peak performance for your workouts.   <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Simply add a scoop to your Sport Formula Shaker Cup, add water and ice to your preference, and you're ready to go!
