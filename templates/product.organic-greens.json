This means you are getting the very best in a powder packed with highly concentrated nutrients. We don't compromise when it comes to the quality of food we put in our body. All of our ingredients are sourced right here in the United States. Sure, it might be more expensive but isn't quality worth it? Isn't you health and well-being worth it?<p><\/p>\n<p>Our greens are cold processed. This means that none of the nutritional integrity of the nutrients has been compromised during the processing and making of our greens. You see, most foods go to store shelves having been heat pasteurized. While this does kill some harmful bacteria and give longer shelf-life to the food, it also kills and denatures much of the nutrient quality the food contains. <\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>So that's why we utilize cold processing in formulating the Organic Greens. Again, it's more expensive but that's what enables us to stand by our 100% satisfaction guarantee. \n<\/p>\n<\/div>","embed":"","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/86_1080x_8c0edda2-0b68-4bd1-8b0c-f71764f2983c.jpg"}}},"block_order":["24460ac0-81b0-4d7f-b95b-ba7a03dcffa2","23f71d2d-06c7-4442-9863-9c74b1216e9d","c806f51f-0032-4adb-a09a-d8ae6fe40171"],"settings":{}},"1626977296e19d58d3":{"type":"two-large-images","blocks":{"75102243-c309-484e-954d-6a4b6825adf6":{"type":"select","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Greens_Bundle_Sup_Facts.jpg","image2":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/3D_Organic_Greens-FRONT_Flat_4c6e6167-c866-46d7-aa98-0cdff5960670.jpg"}}},"block_order":["75102243-c309-484e-954d-6a4b6825adf6"],"settings":{}},"product-certificates":{"type":"product-certificates","blocks":{"8331d8b7-662f-4052-a5da-354f1b42db08":{"type":"content","settings":{"title":"Pro Athlete endorsed","desc":"Don’t be fooled, our exact same nutrients that have fueled Olympic Athletes to achieve Gold Medals is exactly what every human body needs to be healthy.","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Pro_Althlete_Endorsed_642a6831-9789-4544-b1d8-61ab1b79fcb3.jpg"}},"e9a62bca-a575-4c92-9830-681f82a36b5c":{"type":"content","settings":{"title":"FAMILY SAFE PROMISE","desc":"The founder and formulator won’t make any product that he can’t give to his pregnant wife and kids.","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Family_Safe_1d0991a6-2771-4676-bc1c-5626d2e64545.jpg"}},"765e333b-6e41-4bbe-99c3-d5c94f894093":{"type":"content","settings":{"title":"MADE IN THE USA","desc":"Start to finish, Made is U.S.A.
