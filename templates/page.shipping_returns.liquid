    <p>All orders are shipped on the same or next business day.<br>
      The cut off time for same day shipping is usually 12:00 PM Pacific Standard time.<br>
      The exception to this depends on if the carrier decides to come early or late.<br>

      We ship priority mail or FedEx Home Delivery. These 2 options are advertised by the carriers to arrive in 1 to 3 business days.<br>
      All promises aside, the carriers are sometimes slow. Even though we pay them for quick deliveries, they still take as long as they want.<br>
      We provide the tracking numbers they give us and you can get a text message with a delivery notice through aftership by signing up for the delivery notice after checkout is complete..<br>
